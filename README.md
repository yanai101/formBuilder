# Form Builder App

This app build with react for the client and the backend with node+express and MongoDB

### Requirement

you can run this app in two different ways-
  
- The first way - you need a docker installed.

- For the second way you need MongoDB to install and nodeJS as well

### The Doker Way

Simply just run in the root folder this command

    docker-compose up

the apliction will run at "[localhost:8081](localhost:8081)"

  
  

### The nodeJS way

make sure that mondoDB is up and running.

in the server folder ('form-builder-server') - run

  

    npm install
    
    npm start

the server (Express) will serve the app as well - at '[localhost:8081](localhot:8081)' -

no need for another server to serve the client app :)
